          <p>Reduce search time in Database</p>

<h3>Background: </h3>            
<p>I was developing a UI page which has a table that displays objectives set by Employee. There are large number of rows in table(every employee sets atleast 3 objectives), so i used pagination to display contents on table. 
    So the usecase was whenever user clicks on page, react will call my backend api and gets objectives to be displayed on that page.
    Page size is 10.
</p>
<p>
    There are three tables worker, objectives, objectiveAnalysis. For one row in table i have to get data from these three tables.
    So i created three entity models for three tables with onetoone, onetomany relationships.
</p>
<h3>
<strong>My First approach:</strong>
</h3>
<p>First i created jpa repository for Objectives and used Paging fuctionality of PagingAndSorting repository. With this i get rows corresponding to the page.
    But whenever user clicks on page in UI, my backend takes 3-4secs to return the page information to UI.
    3-4secs for each page is lot of time.
</p>
<p>
    Then using hibernate logs and sql logs i found that, for each row in page jpa is doing one select.
    So for 10 rows in a page 10 select queries are executed, and table merges happen 10 times. Because of this turnaround time is high.

<h3>
    <strong>Jpa Optimization</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>To reduce the turnaround time i have to reduce the number of select statements to database.</p>
    <p>For this Jpa has EntityGraph concept. Here we provide the entities to be fetched at runtime, unlike FetchType(Lazy, Eager) which are static and have to be given in model itself.
        In EntityGraph we give associated entities to be fetched when a query is executed. 
    </p>
    <p>When the EntityGraph attributes are given, then jpa gets all the related associations of all rows in one single select statement.</p>
    <p>By using this my application performance enhanced alot. Now the turnaround time is less than 1sec.</p>
